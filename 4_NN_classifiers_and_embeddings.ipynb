    "This notebook is introduces a new library, Pytorch, which we use to construct simple neural networks for processing text. \n",
    "\n",
    "NLP pipelines perform a series of steps to preprocess and then extract features from a piece of text, before inputting these features to a final classifier, sequence labeller, or other output stage. Neural networks allow us to reduce the amount of feature engineering needed in the pipeline, by learning to extract features in the hidden layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like logistic regression, they are disciminative models: they learn the classification task directly, without learning to generate the text. However, unlike logistic regression, they can model nonlinear functions of their inputs. This is achieved by having hidden layers with nonlinear activation functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some key advantages of neural networks can be summarised as:\n",
    "   * It can model nonlinear functions, so can handle much more complex relationships between features and class labels.\n",
    "   * It performs representation learning: the hidden layers learn how to extract features from low-level data.\n",
    "   * It can process sequences of tokens -- we don't have to think in terms of a single feature vector representing a document as we did for logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the downsides are:\n",
    "   * Much more expensive to train and test.\n",
    "   * It can overfit very badly to small datasets.\n",
    "   * The features learned by the hidden layers can be hard to interpret, which can make it hard to predict the model's behaviour, e.g., what sort of cases it may fail on.\n",
    "   * Generalisation is unpredictable: they sometimes behave in unexpected ways when applied to test data outside the training set distribution. \n",

Pytorch is an open source machine learning library that implements multi-dimensional arrays (called \"tensors\") and various mathematical operations on those arrays that are need for many machine learning methods. It supports GPU acceleration and is one of two major frameworks used in deep learning (the other is Tensorflow). \n",

    "   2. The neural network cannot process the tokens as strings, so we need to convert each token to a numerical input value. We can create a vocabulary of token types, then convert each token to its index in the vocabulary. Elsewhere, you may have seen tokens represented by one-hot vectors. For PyTorch, it's not necessary to create one-hot vectors for each token, as the library works with the indexes of tokens directly.  \n",
