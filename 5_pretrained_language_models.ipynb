    "\n",
    "HuggingFace is a company that has developed an open source library for loading pretrained transformer models. They also distribute many models that have been pretrained using language modelling tasks, or fine-tuned to specific downstream NLP tasks.  It is currently the best library to use to create NLP models on top of large, deep neural networks. This is especially useful for tasks where simpler, feature-based methods or smaller LSTM models do not perform well enough, for example, when complex processing of syntax and semantics is required (natural language 'understanding'). \n",
    "\n",
    "The larger models often give great performance, but the trade-off is that they require a lot of memory and compute. When building a model for a new dataset, it is a good idea to compare faster models with transformers to determine whether the performance/cost trade-off is worth it on that particular dataset. \n",

    "Typically, sequence classification models attach a linear layer (classification head) to the outputs of the transformer. The CLS token's embedding is passed into the classification head, which makes a prediction over classes. We can see a similar structure in most neural network models. Our original text classifier from the first notebook used a fully-connected layer to produce a hidden representation of the whole sentence, whereas now we are replacing that hidden layer with a complete BERT transformer, which produces a sequence of embeddings. \n",
